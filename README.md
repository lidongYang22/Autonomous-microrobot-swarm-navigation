# Autonomous microrobot swarm navigation enabled by DL-based real-time distribution planning
Sample codes for training of Voronoi-tessellation-assisted convolutional neural network.  
The present framework achieves robust global field reconstructions based on neural networks for moving and arbitrary number of sensors.
